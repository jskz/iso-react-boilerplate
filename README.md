# iso-react-boilerplate

I wanted a plain boilerplate for isomorphic [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) projects without the overhead
of stripping away this or that popular take on immutables when I just want to
tinker with this or that component.   

Routes are matched and rendered on the server before the client React bundle
takes over.  [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) is included to
demonstrate the precedence of nested Helmet components.
